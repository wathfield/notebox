This JavaScript code includes functions to render notes, handle button clicks, and event listeners for button clicks. The renderNotes function dynamically creates note elements based on the provided data. You can replace the sample data with actual data fetched from a database in a real application.

With this basic structure in place, you can further expand and refine the functionality according to your requirements.
